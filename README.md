This repository conteins the evolution of the project for IUM(6 credits).

In it there is a directory name solution with our solution of the project, a Jupyter Noteboot.
For the right execution of the Jupyter Notebook there are some packets which are necessary to install:
  jupyter(1.0.0)
  matplotlib(3.8.5)
  pandas(2.2.0rc0)
  seaborn(0.13.1)
  pymongo(4.6.1)

The version of the packets is the one that we have use, other version could have an success full execution or not.

Emphasize, in the first cell of the Jupyter Notebook is where the conection to the database is made, the name that 
is right now is the one that we had in or local database, for the right execution of the notebook you may need 
to change that name to your.

The other two directories, report and queryexamples in which the report one conteins the report of the proyect and 
queryexamples conteins three query examples of the Jupyter Notebook.
