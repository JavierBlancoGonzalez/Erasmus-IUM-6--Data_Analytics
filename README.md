This repository contains the evolution of the project for IUM(6 credits).

In it there is a directory name solution with our solution of the project, a Jupyter Notebook. 
For the right execution of the Jupyter Notebook there are some packages which are necessary to install: 
  jupyter(1.0.0)
  matplotlib(3.8.5)
  pandas(2.2.0rc0)
  seaborn(0.13.1)
  pymongo(4.6.1)

The version of the packages is the one that we have used, other versions could have a successful execution or not.

Emphasize, in the first cell of the Jupyter Notebook is where the connection to the database is made, the name 
that is right now is the one that we had in our local database, for the right execution of the notebook you may 
need to change that name to your.

The other two directories, report and queryexamples in which the report one contains the report of the project 
and queryexamples contains three query examples of the Jupyter Notebook.
